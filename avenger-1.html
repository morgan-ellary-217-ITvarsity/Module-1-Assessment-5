         <p>Born 1500 years ago to Odin and Frigga, the king and queen of fabled Asgard, Thor grew into a mighty warrior and protector of his home and people. Thor, like all Asgardians, possesses great strength, endurance, stamina, and long life, but it’s his command of lighting and thunder that defines him from the rest of his kind and make him easily recognized as the Son of the Allfather, Odin. He believes that it’s his hammer, Mjolnir, which gives him this abilities, but the hammer is merely a tool to help him control the powers he already has.
